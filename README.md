There are 3 main funtions that this project can do:
1. Single Tweet.
2. Multiple Tweet at a certain inteval of time.
3. Look up a hashtag and retweet the tweet having that hashtag and also follow the user tweeting.
4. Unfollow all the users that you have followed.

For this project to work, you need to have your twitter tokens or access keys.
To get those keys, sign up in https://apps.twitter.com and create a new app.
Give your information and you will recieve 4 keys.
These keys are to be inserted into every .py file in their respective places
